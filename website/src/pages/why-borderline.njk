  <p>
    Borderline didn’t start as a serious project. It started the same way a lot
    of modern geography obsessions do: with a few easy
    <strong>geography TikTok videos</strong>
    that asked you to guess a country from its outline.
  </p>

  <p>
    At first, it felt harmless. “Surely I know this one.” Then the outlines got
    harder. Smaller. Stranger.
  </p>

  <p>Somewhere along the way, curiosity turned into obsession.</p>

  <h2>From casual guessing to total map awareness</h2>

  <p>
    Borderline exists for people who don’t just want to recognise the big,
    obvious countries. It’s for anyone who’s ever stared at a tiny island
    outline and thought,
    <em>“I should know this.”</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    The idea is simple: <strong>learn the world by its shapes</strong>. Not by
    memorising capitals or flags, but by recognising the land itself. Every
    coast, every curve, every awkward little speck.
  </p>

  <h2>Why outlines work</h2>

  <p>
    When you remove labels, borders, and hints, something interesting happens:
    you start seeing geography differently.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>You stop guessing based on trivia and start recognising patterns.</li>
    <li>You learn where places actually sit in relation to each other.</li>
    <li>You build real spatial memory, not just facts.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Over time, those outlines stop being random shapes. They become instantly
    recognisable — even the obscure ones.
  </p>

  <h2>Every speck counts</h2>

  <p>
    Borderline doesn’t stop at the usual list of countries. It includes
    <strong>territories, dependencies, and tiny islands</strong> that most games
    ignore.
  </p>

  <p>
    The goal isn’t to trip you up for fun. It’s to help you build a complete
    mental map of the world — including the parts that rarely get attention.
  </p>

  <h2>It’s a game, but it rewires how you see maps</h2>

  <p>
    Play long enough and something changes. You start spotting countries
    instantly. You recognise coastlines without thinking. You know where places
    belong before you can name them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Borderline exists because once you start learning geography this way, it’s
    hard to stop.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you’ve ever wanted to know
    <strong>every single little speck on Earth just by looking at it</strong>,
    you’re in the right place.
