  <p>
    Easy mode is the most forgiving way to play Borderline. All country and territory
    outlines are visible, giving you full geographic context while you learn to recognise
    shapes. There’s no time penalty here, so you can take a breath, look closely,
    and build real map intuition.
  </p>

  <p>
    This mode is ideal if you’re new to outline-based geography games, brushing up on
    world maps, or just warming up before harder levels. You’ll still need to identify
    countries by shape — but the surrounding outlines help anchor everything in place.
  </p>

  <h2>What makes Easy mode different</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>All country and territory outlines are visible</li>
    <li>No time penalty — accuracy over speed</li>
    <li>Includes countries, observer states, and territories</li>
    <li>Designed for learning and confidence-building</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Scoring in Easy mode</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Maximum score: <strong>2000 points</strong></li>
    <li>Wrong guess: <strong>−200 points</strong></li>
    <li>Time penalty: <strong>none</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Easy mode rewards careful thinking. Take your time, study the outlines,
    and focus on getting each answer right rather than rushing.
