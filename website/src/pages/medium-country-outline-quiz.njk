        <p>
            Medium mode removes the safety net without throwing you into the deep end.
            Continent outlines are still visible, but individual country borders disappear.
            You get orientation — not answers.
        </p>
        <p>
            This mode is designed to sharpen your geographic instincts. You’ll rely less on
            memorised shapes and more on relative position, scale, and regional familiarity.
            It’s where the world map starts to feel internal rather than observed.

  <h2>What makes Medium mode different</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Only continent outlines are visible</li>
    <li>Countries appear without surrounding borders</li>
    <li>Balanced difficulty: context without hand-holding</li>
    <li>Ideal bridge between Easy and Hard</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Scoring in Medium mode</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Maximum score: <strong>2000 points</strong></li>
    <li>Wrong guess: <strong>−200 points</strong></li>
    <li>Time penalty: <strong>−10 points per second</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Speed matters more here than in Easy mode, but accuracy still wins.
    A calm, confident guess beats frantic clicking every time.
