  <h2 id="how-to-play-title">How to Play</h2>
  <p>
    Your goal is simple:
    <strong>guess the country or territory from its outline</strong>. Type your
    answer, submit, repeat until you’re right — or dramatically wrong.
  </p>

  <p>
    Borderline is a fast, visual <strong>geography guessing game</strong>. No
    flags. No capitals. Just shape recognition and a timer that does not care
    about your feelings.

      <img src="/assets/images/easy.png" alt="Easy" width="200" />
      <p>
        All country and territory outlines are visible. Perfect for warm-up
        laps, learning shapes, and quiet confidence.
        <strong>No time penalty</strong> in this mode.

      <p>
        Only continent outlines are shown. You get context, not hand-holding.
        Great for building real map instincts without giving you the answer for
        free.

      <p>
        No outlines at all. Just the target shape floating in space. Pure
        cartographic nerve: if you know it, you know it — if you don’t, the
        guess count will tell on you.

      <img src="/assets/images/extreme.png" alt="Extreme" width="200" />
      <p>
        No outlines, and only small islands and territories. Tiny landmasses,
        unfamiliar names, and “I swear I’ve seen this shape before” energy.

      <p>
        A fixed-view mode: no moving the map, no excuses. Built for maximum
        difficulty. <small>(Coming soon)</small>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>195</strong> UN-recognised countries</li>
    <li><strong>2</strong> observer states: Vatican City and Palestine</li>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Maximum score:</strong> 2000 points</li>
      <li><strong>Wrong guess:</strong> −200 points</li>
      <li><strong>Time penalty:</strong> −10 points per second</li>

  <section id="weekly-leaderboard" aria-labelledby="weekly-leaderboard-title">
    <h2 id="weekly-leaderboard-title">Weekly Leaderboard</h2>

    <p>
      Borderline runs a <strong>weekly leaderboard</strong> that rewards strong
      starts, not endless grinding. Every player gets a fair shot each week.
    </p>

    <p>
      Only your <strong>first 20 games of the week</strong> count towards the
      leaderboard. After that, you can keep playing as much as you like — your
      score just won’t affect the rankings.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The leaderboard resets every week</li>
      <li>Only the first 20 games are counted</li>
      <li>Best total score across those games wins</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This keeps the competition skill-based rather than time-based. Play smart
      early, then relax — or keep chasing personal glory.

  <section id="why-borderline" aria-labelledby="why-borderline-title">
    <h2 id="why-borderline-title">Why Borderline Is Different</h2>

    <p>
      Most geography games either drown you in hints or turn into trivia about
      capitals and flags. Borderline stays visual:
      <strong>you learn the world by recognising shapes</strong>.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>A real outline challenge.</strong> No multiple choice. You’re
        identifying the map itself.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Difficulty that actually scales.</strong> Easy teaches, Hard
        tests, Extreme exposes the gaps.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Territories included.</strong> The world is bigger than the
        usual list, and Borderline doesn’t pretend otherwise.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fast rounds, instant feedback.</strong> One guess away from a
        win or a very specific kind of embarrassment.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you want a game that makes you better at geography — not just better at
      guessing — start with Easy, then climb until the map fights back.
    </p>
