  <h1 id="why-borderline-title">Why Borderline?</h1>

  <p>
    Borderline started by chance: a few easy
    <strong>Geography TikTok videos</strong>
    that asked people to guess a country from its outline.
  </p>

  <p>
    At first, it felt harmless. “Geography? Not my thing, but I know this is Italy.” 
    Then the outlines got harder. Smaller. Stranger.
  </p>

  <p>Somewhere along the way, curiosity turned into obsession.</p>
  
  <h2>Recognition is the point</h2>

  <p>
    Borderline exists for players who already know the obvious countries — and want to find out what comes next.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is not about learning facts.
    It is not about explanations.
    It does not help you.
  </p>

  <p>
    You are shown a shape.
    You either recognise it — or you don’t.
  </p>

  <p>
    Speed matters. Accuracy matters. Excuses don’t.
  </p>

  <h2>Why outlines</h2>

  <p>
    Remove names, borders, and hints, and something uncomfortable happens:
    there’s nowhere to hide.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>You can’t rely on trivia.</li>
    <li>You can’t reason your way out.</li>
    <li>You either see it — or you fail.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Over time, the outlines stop looking random.
    They become familiar. Immediate. Undeniable.
  </p>

  <p>That recognition is earned.</p>

  <h2>The small ones count</h2>

  <p>
    Borderline includes <strong>territories, dependencies, and tiny islands</strong> most games ignore.
  </p>

  <p>
    Not for completeness.
    For separation.
  </p>

  <p>
    If a shape looks like “just a speck” to you, that tells us enough.
  </p>

  <h2>Progression is identity</h2>

  <p>
    Borderline isn’t infinite play.
    It’s a daily performance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Levels aren’t unlocked by time or money.
    They’re unlocked when the game decides you belong there.
  </p>

  <p>
    Easy stops being interesting.
    Hard becomes normal.
    Extreme becomes necessary.
  </p>

  <p>
    If a level feels unfair, that’s intentional.
    Difficulty is a promise.
  </p>

  <h2>This is not for everyone</h2>

  <p>
    Borderline doesn’t congratulate you.
    It doesn’t explain mistakes.
    It doesn’t slow down.
  </p>

  <p>
    It exists for players who enjoy being tested — publicly, repeatedly, without assistance.
  </p>

  <p>
    If that sounds appealing, you’re already where you need to be.
    If it doesn’t, that’s fine too.
